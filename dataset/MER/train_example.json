        "instruction": "You are an expert in transforming process descriptions into structured BPMN representations. Your task is to analyze the textual description of a process and transform it into a MER file that follows this structure:\n``` mer\n        startEvent_ID(startEventLabel)-->nodeBPMNType_ID(targetLabel)\n        nodeBPMNType_ID(sourceLabel)-->nodeBPMNType_ID(targetLabel)\n        ...\n        nodeBPMNType_ID(sourceLabel)-->endEvent_ID(endEventLabel)\n        lane_ID(laneLabel)\n            nodeBPMNType_ID\n            nodeBPMNType_ID\n            ...\n        end\\n\n```\n\nKey Rules:\n1. Lanes:\n- Include lanes only if multiple actors (or roles) are explicitly mentioned.\n- Exclude lanes if only \"You\" is mentioned as the actor.\n- When lanes exist, all BPMN elements, including start and end nodes, must belong to a lane.\n- Assign start and end nodes to the most appropriate lanes.\n2. Flows:\n- Tasks must have exactly one incoming and one outgoing connection.\n- Gateways:\n-- Splitting Gateway: 1 incoming, multiple outgoing.\n-- Merging Gateway: Multiple incoming, 1 outgoing.\n3. BPMN Element Types:\n- Events: startEvent, endEvent\n- Tasks: task, userTask, serviceTask, scriptTask, manualTask, sendTask, receiveTask, businessRuleTask\n- Gateways: exclusiveGateway, parallelGateway\n4. Output Requirements:\n- Be precise and consistent in assigning unique IDs, labels, and roles.\n- Do not include any additional information that is not reported in the textual description. \n- Always ensure logical flow and consistency between tasks and decisions.\n- Only return the MER file. Avoid any other information or intermediate step.\n\n\n### EXAMPLES: \n\nInput: \"The following description is about the Accounts payable process, which starts with sending to the vendor accounting department.

The hardware retailer clerk is responsible for deciding whether the shipment will be handled via normal post or through a special carrier. If the normal post is selected, the clerk checks if extra insurance is necessary for the shipment. If extra insurance is required, the logistics manager steps in to arrange it. Regardless of whether insurance is needed or not, the clerk fills in a post label for the shipment. On the other hand, if the shipment is to be handled by a special carrier, the clerk requests quotes from different carriers. Once the quotes are received, the clerk assigns a carrier and prepares the necessary paperwork for the shipment. It is important to note that when using a special carrier, insurance is typically included in the service, so there is no need to take out additional insurance.\nWhile the clerical work is being handled, a warehouse worker packages the goods to prepare them for shipment. After the goods are packaged, the warehouse worker adds the necessary paperwork to the shipment and moves the package to the designated pick area.

The buyer then decides whether to continue shopping or to proceed with the purchase. If they choose to keep shopping, they return to browsing; if not, they move on to finalize the purchase. At this stage, the system asks them to select a payment method from a list. After choosing a method, the buyer provides the necessary payment details.
